# STL Data API Project Code of Conduct
The STL Data API project is a collaborative effort to build a centralized platform for accessing St. Louis regional public data. We value inclusivity, respect, and professionalism in all interactions. This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, meetings, Slack/Discord channels, emails, and any other communication related to the project.
By participating, you agree to uphold these guidelines. We expect all contributors developers, tech leads, stakeholders, and users, to foster a welcoming environment.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our community and our contributions to the project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We aim to create a space where people from all backgrounds feel empowered to contribute, learn, and grow. As juniors and mentors work together, we emphasize patience, constructive feedback, and mutual support.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:
- Respectful Communication: Use welcoming and inclusive language. Be considerate of others' time and perspectives.
- Empathy and Kindness: Assume best intentions. Offer help to juniors or those learning new technologies (e.g., Kafka, Flask, CQRS).
- Constructive Feedback: In code reviews, focus on the code, not the person. Provide specific, actionable suggestions.
- Collaboration: Credit ideas appropriately. Celebrate team wins, like completing a sprint milestone.
- Inclusivity: Encourage diverse viewpoints. If someone shares a unique approach to data ingestion or API design, amplify it.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment: Any form of verbal, written, or physical abuse, including targeted insults based on identity.
- Discrimination: Jokes or comments that marginalize based on protected characteristics.
- Disruption: Derailing discussions, spamming channels, or ignoring feedback requests.
- Unprofessional Conduct: Sharing private information, plagiarism in code/docs, or aggressive debates that escalate.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers (Tech Lead and senior contributors) are responsible for:
- Clarifying standards for acceptable behavior and moderating spaces.
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct consistently and fairly.
- Resolving conflicts through mediation, when possible.
- Encouraging a supportive onboarding for juniors (e.g., via setup.md and sprint kickoffs).

All community members are responsible for:
- Upholding the Code in all project interactions.
- Reporting violations promptly.

## Scope
This Code applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when representing the project (e.g., at conferences discussing STL data APIs). It does not cover off-topic or unrelated conduct.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Tech Lead or via a private GitHub issue labeled "conduct". All reports will be reviewed confidentially and promptly.

- Minor Violations: A private warning and reminder of guidelines.
- Serious Violations: Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces, as needed.
- Repeated Issues: Escalation to project sponsors or external mediation.

We take reports seriously and protect reporters from retaliation. Enforcement decisions are at the discretion of maintainers, but aim for fairness and transparency.
